- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cody Markham aka @cgmarkham64
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in exploring the MERN stack and creating full stack applications in general
- ðŸŒ± I'm always learning new things; in 2020 I learned how to create Docker images for a suite of microservices 
     and deploy them to a live server environment, in 2021 I'm bettering myself with more algorithm practice while refamiliarizing myself with ReactJS
