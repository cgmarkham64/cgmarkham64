- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cody Markham! Iâ€™m a full stack software engineer currently employed at Maxar Technologies. Recently at work, I've been using AWS services and systems to host a suite of Python based microservices that aid in the image formation process of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. In my free time I've been playing with a React portfolio project that I envision eventually turning into a full stack application to showcase my skills and systems experience.
